#Arduino Quadruped Robot

Arduino Quadruped Robot the project delivered from upstream project [RegisHsu](http://goo.gl/H1vvwW)'s spider robot. This project has been redesigned in 3d printed parts eg: didn't glue servo holder with tibia and fumer, resize body to fit [12300 LIPO battery](http://goo.gl/VmvYhv). You don't need bluetooth remote control anymore, you can control robot, using [Android App Bluetooth Joystick](https://github.com/anoochit/android-robot-bt-joypad) instead, [get app from Google PlayStore](https://goo.gl/MF46JS).

##Assemply 

Assembly the printed parts for 4 legs with servos, don't screw servo axis at this time, then assembly legs with body.

Assemply electronic parts (schematic'll add later)

 * Servo pulse pin connect to Arduino Nano pin D2-D13
 * Servo VCC and GND connect to regulator output
 * Bluetooth HC-05 Vcc to to Arduino Nano 5V pin, GND, RX-TX and TX-RX
 * Arduino Nano, Vin and GND connect to regulator output 5v
 * Use dc jack connect with LIPO battery
 * Connect battery to input of regulator for stepdown output to 5v

Group servo wire use order Fumer, Tibia, Coxa, connect servos to arduino pin for each leg

 * Lelf Front connect to pin D2-D4
 * Lelf Back connect to pin D5-D7
 * Right Front connect to pin D8-D10
 * Right Back connect to pin D11-D13

Flash leg_init.ino script to initial servo angle then screw tight all servo axis, leg position like picture.

Flash spider_robot.ino to Arduino, Finish.

##How to play

Clone joystick app build and install or [get app from Google PlayStore](https://goo.gl/MF46JS) to your mobile phone, open app, swipe and choose connect menu, choose robot bluetooth to connect.
